Users (buyers and producers) can permanently delete their account.
Account deletion requires authentication and explicit confirmation.
When a buyer deletes their account, their purchase history is retained for audit purposes but disassociated from personal identifiers.
When a producer deletes their account, their beats are removed from public listings and can no longer be purchased.
Deleted accounts cannot be recovered.
