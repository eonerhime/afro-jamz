Producers can upload a beat along with metadata including title, genre, tempo, duration, and preview audio.
Each beat must include at least one selectable licensing term that defines price and usage rights.
The uploaded beat appears on the producer's public profile page.
The system must reject uploads that violate metadata requirements or licensing rules.
